Hello!
this will be my first pseudo - real project, as of now its only html but in the distant future perhaps css too.
my hopes for this is to demonstrate understanding in the basics and fundamentals of html with the theme of a recipe page, so hopefully by the end of this excercise not only will i have proved what i know, but ill also learn more to compliment that.
