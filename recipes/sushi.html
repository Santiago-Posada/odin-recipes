    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First off, before we do anything you're gonna have to do 2 things: 1. gather all the ingredients right now 2. preheat the oven to 300F</li>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.</li>
        <li>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center.</li>
        <li>Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.</li>
        <li>Serve and eat!</li>
    </ol>
